 *  What is the Scope ?:
 * 
 * Scope is the current execution context in which values and expressions are "visible."
 * If a variable or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use.

/**
 * JavaScript has two types of scope.
 * 
 * Global Scope and Local Scope.

/*
So what is the difference between the global and local scope?

The difference between global and local scope is that variables declared with 
global scope persist throughout the entire program execution, while variables declared 
with local scope exist only during the execution of the specific function or block.
