/**
 * 
 * What is Mocha?
 * 
 * is a widely used javascript test framework running on Node.js and the browser.
 * It supports asyncronous testing running the test serially , allowing for more
 * flexible and accute reporting. It is a highly customizable framework that
 * supports different assertions and libraries.
 * 
 * What is Chai?
 * 
 * Chai is an assertion library that is mostly used alongside Mocha, it can be used
 * both as a BDD/TDD assertion library for NodeJS and can be paired with any
 * JavaScript testing framework. It has several interfaces that a developer can
 * choose from and looks much like writting test in English.
 * 
 * But what is an assertion library?
 * 
 * Assertion libraries are tools to verify that things are correct.
  This makes it a lot easier to test your code, so you don't have to do 
  thousands of if statements.
