/* 

  Big Os
    
    O(1) Constant - No loops

    O(logN)Logarithmic - usually searching algorithms 
                         have log n if they are sorted(Binary Search)
    
    O(n) Linear - For Loops, while loops, through n items

    O(n log(n)) Log linear - usually sortings operations

    O(^2) Quadratic - Every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other
                      element, two nested Loops

    0(2) Exponencial - recursive algorithms that solves a problem of Size N
