A Asynchronous

A &
X: XML

The tradicional http request having a big disadvantage in the performance
in our app,because the request are sincronous that means that the user have
to wait the response of the server for keep interacting in the web app.

But in asyncronous the http request are send with the need of wait for
a response the user can keep interacting with the web app and only
when responses is received the app show us the data

- Ajax allow us to send and receive data from the server using javascript

What means that we can interact with the server in real-time without the need
of reload the page

The data send in ajax request use the format XML that why the name in
the name ajax but that was in old days, nowdays the Ajax use for send
the data is JSON
