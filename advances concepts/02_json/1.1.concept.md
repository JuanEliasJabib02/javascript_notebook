<!-- What is a JSONP -->

JSONP is a method for sending JSON data without worrying about cross-domain issues

JSONP is used if CORS cannot be enabled by server or for old browsers. JSONP actually uses script tag to get the data from the server. Script is allowed to be fetched from any domain, So in JSONP, we need to create a script with the url as src and the server has to wrap the response in a callback function. Response sent by server is actually a javascript code which contains data inside a wrapper function. In JSONP, there is no ajax call being made.
