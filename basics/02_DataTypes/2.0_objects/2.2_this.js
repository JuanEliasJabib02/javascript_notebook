// Keyword this:

/*
 -This keyword do reference to the object in current ejecution
and depends of the context  do reference to distints objects

What is "context" in dev?
The context is the object in current ejecution in a specific moment

 -This is all about where a function is invoked. Often,
early programmers worry about where the function was declared.
 Perhaps the function was declared in a specific file or a particular object. 

 Surely this changes it's this
 
 To understand this, we need to see where it is invoked.
Nothing else matters, with one exception which we'll cover in a moment.

/**
 * What is binding?
 * 
 * Is Assign the value that gonna take this when executing the function

 * 
 * Default Biding(Direct invocation)

 * Explicit Biding(Indirect function)
 * New Binding(instantiate objects)
 * Lexical Binding(Arrow functions)

 */

/*1.Default Binding */

/* Default binding refers to how this is the global context whenever a function 
  is invoked without any of these other rules. If we aren't using a dot and we 
  aren't using call(), apply(), or bind(), our this will be our global object.

  Your global context depends on where you're working. If you're in the browser, 
  this will be the window. When programming in strict mode, the global context is undefined.
  */

// A good practice is not use this in global contex

/** 2. Implicit Binding
 * 
 * Implicit binding occurs when dot notation is used to invoke a function.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 */

/**
 * In implicit binding, whatever is to the left of the dot(.) 
 * becomes the context for this in the function. 
 */


//3.Explicit Biding

/**
 * Explicit binding of this occurs when .call(), .apply(), or .bind() 
 * are used on a function.
 * 
 * We call these explicit because you are explicitly passing in a this context to call() or apply(). 
 * Weâ€™ll talk bind() in just a moment.
