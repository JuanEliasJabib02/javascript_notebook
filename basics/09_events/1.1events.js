/* 
 When a event occures, 3 phases are produced
 
 The first phase es Capture:

 In this phase is searching for the element on the dom
 more deep where  was procuded the event.


 The second phase is the target:

 In this phase is check if the element of the doom where was localizated the event
 has a listener assiocied to it

 And the third phase is the bubbling:

  The bubbling not always occures, not all the events have this phase depends of the type
  of the event.

  This event when the target execute the envent, start to search if the elements parents
  have exist a listener for the same type de event and execute it too

  and this is a problem to avoid.
 */

/*
 The second way to stop it is using delegation

 Using the bubbling effect we can know what was the element that the user did click 
  */
